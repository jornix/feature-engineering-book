    "# Log Transform in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how the log transform performs for supervised learning. We’ll use both of the previous datasets here. For the Yelp reviews dataset, we’ll use the number of reviews to predict the average rating of a business (see Example 2-8). For the Mashable news articles, we’ll use the number of words in an article to predict its popularity. Since the outputs are continuous numbers, we’ll use simple linear regression as the model. We use scikit-learn to perform 10-fold cross validation of linear regression on the feature with and without log transformation. The models are evaluated by the R-squared score, which measures how well a trained regression model predicts new data. Good models have high R-squared scores. A perfect model gets the maximum score of 1. The score can be negative, and a bad model can get an arbitrarily low negative score. Using cross validation, we obtain not only an estimate of the score but also a variance, which helps us gauge whether the differences between the two models are meaningful."
